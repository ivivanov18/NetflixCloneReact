# Netflix React Clone
This is a Netflix clone with React and Typescript.
The project is greatly inspired from the Youtube tutorial **[How to Build a NETFLIX Clone with REACT JS for Beginners (in 3 Hours!)]**(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtMThy8QKqU&t). 

There are several small differences:
- the current project is set without *create-react-app* but from scratch using webpack
- the current project is written in Typescript
- the current project includes testing with jest/enzyme for the different components
